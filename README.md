# PredictDiabetes

## Pima Indian Diabetes Data overview

Female patients at least 21 years old
768 patients observation rows
10 columns -> 9 featues columns + 1 diabetes col (True/False)


## Rule 1
closer the data is to what you are predicting, the better

## rule 2

data needs to be formatted the way we need it

## algorithm decision factors
1. learning type
2. result
3. complexity
4. basic vs enhanced

"Use the ML Workflow to process and transform Pima Indian Data to Create a prediction model. This Model must predict which people are likely to develop diabetes woth 70% or greater accuracy"

Prediction Model => Supervised ML (binary output)

we will stick to basic algos.
1. Nave Bayes (We use this)
2. Logistic Regession
3. Decision Tree

## Training overview

split the data : 70% Training + 30% Testing
training the model with Algo

## Performance Improvement Options

after training the data and makeing the predictions for the test data we can improve the predition of Ture positives

- adjust current algo
- get more data or improve data
- improve data
- switch algorithm and check which algo suits best
